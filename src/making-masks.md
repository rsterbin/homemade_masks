There are a lot of face mask patterns and tutorials around online. How do you know which one is best?

To pick a mask, you should consider:

* Will it be comfortable enough to wear for long periods? Some people find the elastic in ear loops abrasive when worn for long periods. Others struggle not to touch the nose guard when it's installed at the top edge.
* What materials do you have at home? If you don't have a sewing machine or the perfect fabric, now is not the time to make an unnecessary purchase. If you have a basic sewing kit and a cotton T-shirt or pillowcase, you can still make a sewn mask.
* Can you sew? If you can't, there's no need wait until you'ved developed a whole new skill to start wearing a mask. There are a number of no-sew masks to choose from, so if you really want to learn to sew, you'll have a mask to wear while you figure it out.
* Do the materials you have provide enough of a filter for your needs? If you want to add extra filtering capabilities, making a mask with a pocket will allow you to use a disposable filtering material as well.

### No-Sew patterns

The CDC provides two simple options: one made from an old T-Shirt, and one made from a bandana.  You can find the patterns at the [bottom of the page here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html).

Here's a video tutorial for the T-shirt option:

And here's one of the bandana options:

If you need a disposable mask, you can create one from paper towels and rubber bands using a stapler:

These options are very simple, which is great! But they do have a few downsides: they're squared off instead of curved to fit the face, the sides are left open, they don't have anything in the top edge to mold to your nose, and they need to be reassembled after each wash. If you want to try something a little more difficult that might fit you better, here are a few options:

### Sewn patterns

The best sewn pattern is the one that you find comfortable and well-fitting. There are a lot of variations, but they tend to fall into one of three categories: cloth versions of surgical masks, shaped masks, and masks that combine the other two styles.

#### Cloth versions of surgical masks

The basic surgical mask is a rectangle folded into three horizontal pleats, secured with either elastic ear loops or long ties. This is a simple and effective pattern, and the pattern can easily be adjusted to fit people of all sizes.

Here's a video tutorial for a cloth surgical mask:

Variations (video demonstrations):

* [Four-layer mask with ties and side binding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd4D5Ogepk)
* [Mask with ties, nose guard, and filter pocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3lcPRHo_nY)

#### Shaped masks

These masks are cut in a curved pattern that creates a close-fitting cup around the face. They're usually seamed at the center and don't have any pleating or gathers. Many people find them much more comfortable than the surgical style, but adjusting or scaling the pattern to fit different sizes and face shapes can be difficult.

Here's a video tutorial for a shaped mask using the [Fu mask pattern](https://freesewing.org/docs/patterns/fu/):

#### Combined style masks

These masks borrow from both styles, using a curved pattern but including pleats or gathers at the side to fit more people.

Here's a video tutorial for a combined style mask using the [AB mask pattern](https://www.instructables.com/id/AB-Mask-for-a-Nurse-by-a-Nurse/):

### Tips

When sewing your mask, keep a few things in mind:

1. Knowing which side has been against your face is really important, so make sure your inner and outer sides are either made of different fabrics, or have an obvious front and back.

2. Sewing elastic is very difficult to find these days. If you want to make an ear-loops style mask, and you don't already have elastic already on hand, you can use elastic hair ties or rubber bands. Because these options can irritate the skin over time, you might want add a fabric cover for them.

3. Backstitch over the parts of your mask that will take the most strain -- strap attachment points, pleats, and darts can all use a little extra reinforcement.

4. Prewash your fabric. Your masks will need to be washed in hot water to be sterilized, and you don't want to waste time making a mask that will go out of shape after the first wash.

5. When making pleats, make sure they point down, with the pocket created by the pleat opening downward. This helps reduce the amount of dirt and other particulates getting caught within the pleats.

## Mask Materials

The right material for a mask needs to be dense enough to filter out small particles, but thin enough to breathe through. Fortunately, there have been a few studies and independent experiments testing various materials on both counts.

This chart is from a study in 2013 testing particles smaller than the novel coronavirus:

And here's a chart from the same study, testing breathability:

![Mask materials by breathability](/images/effectiveness2.jpg)

The study authors recommended using two layers of either a T-shirt or a pillowcase, given how easily available those materials are and how well they balance filtration and breathability.

However, [another experiment this year](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-diy-coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-covid/) using a broader set of materials showed much worse filtration numbers for both (15% and 24%). This could easily be because both T-shirts and pillowcases are available in a lot of different weights, which means that the fibers may be packed very close in one T-shirt (making it an excellent filter) but very loosely in another. It indicated that natural fibers tended to perform better than synthetic ones, which is consistent with the first study, but there simply isn't a standard weight for T-shirts and pillowcases.

To select a fabric, you'll have to guess at its density and breathability, but fortunately there's an easy way to compare any fabrics you have on hand. First, hold them up to a light and compare how bright the light appears through each of them (this is your best guess at filtration effectiveness). Next, hold each one up to your mouth and nose and see how hard it is to breathe through. Try 2-4 layers of each. How you feel breathing through each fabric is the best information you have about how comfortable it will be to wear your mask.

### How many cloth masks do I need?

At the very least, you need two: one to wear, and one to wash. If your situation involves going out in public more than once a day, or if you don't want to have to wash your used mask every night, you might want to have a few more. If you're using a disposable mask, you need one for each outing. (If you're using a disposable filter in a cloth mask, the same applies.)
