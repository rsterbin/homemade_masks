There are three main kinds of masks.  They provide different levels of protection and are recommended for use in different contexts.

### Respirator mask (N95)

The gold standard for masks is the respirator mask (N95).  This mask is capable of filtering out 95% of particles as small as 0.007 microns. (The novel coronavirus is 0.1 microns, which is why medical professionals use N95s to treat COVID-19 patients safely.) It fits tightly around the nose and mouth, creating a seal to prevent any unfiltered air from getting in.  N95 masks must be fit-tested to ensure that they're airtight.  Traditionally, they're considered disposable: under normal conditions, a new mask would be required for each patient encounter.

However, there is currently a national shortage of N95 masks.  In order to ensure that medical care is available for as many people as possible, they **must** be reserved for health care workers.  Health care workers are already re-using masks: in the hardest-hit places, a single mask may be used for an entire shift, or even multiple shifts.

If you happen to have N95 masks at home, it's a good idea to contact your local hospital to see if they need donations.  Every respirator in the hands of a health care worker helps save lives.

**Important:** Masks called "N95" are also used in non-medical settings -- for example, in construction, to filter out dust particles. These masks include a single-direction vent that allows air to pass quickly out of the mask but be filtered coming in. *Please DO NOT use these, or any other mask with a vent!* A mask that doesn't filter your breath on the way out will do nothing to protect the people around you.

### Surgical masks

The other kind of mask used in a medical setting is the basic surgical mask.  These masks vary in their filtering, typically block 1-micron particles, and are not tightly fitted.  They are also disposable, and should never be reused.

Surgical masks are more widely available than N95s, but there are still some shortages, especially in places where N95s are not available.  As much as possible, they should be reserved for health care and other essential workers.

### Cloth Masks

Cloth masks are not as effective at filtering small particles as either N95 or surgical masks, but they do still provide some protection.  Used properly, they can filter out 20-60% of 0.02 micron particles (less than half the size of the coronavirus).

How effective a cloth mask is, though, depends on what materials it's made of, and whether it's worn *correctly* and *safely*.
