The CDC has recommended that everyone wear masks in public. What does that mean, and what do you need to know?

### Why you should wear a mask: to protect others

COVID-19 is spread primarily through droplets of moisture from the mouth and nose.  Sneezing or coughing sprays them into the air around you, and there's some evidence that just breathing can spread smaller amounts of the virus shorter distances.  If you're carrying the virus, any mask you wear will keep most of those droplets from coming in contact with the people around you.

This is especially important now that we know nearly half of all people infected with the coronavirus don't have any symptoms.  Some of them will go on to develop symptoms in a few days, while others never will, but all of them can still infect other people.  Even if you're feeling perfectly healthy, it's important to wear a mask to reduce the risk that you'll pass it on to someone more vulnerable.

### Why you should wear a mask: to protect yourself

You may have heard early in the pandemic that there's no need to wear a mask, because outside of a medical respirator, no easily-available mask can filter out particles as small as the coronavirus. This early recommendation was made for two reasons:

First, because there were already signs that a shortage in medical masks was on the horizon, and reserving them for health care workers was a necessary intervention to keep the medical system from collapsing when too many doctors and nurses got sick.

Secondly, because while the research clearly indicates that masks of all kinds reduce the droplets in the air when the wearer coughs or sneezes, the research on how well the wearer is protected when others cough or sneeze isn't nearly as clear. Some studies show they make a difference, while others show no effect.

For example, a study of parents caring for children with the flu showed no significant difference in how often the parents became infected, whether they wore a mask or not. But another study in Hong Kong after the avian flu outbreak showed that people who consistently wore a mask in public were half as likely to be infected.

Given that there's a lot of mixed data, it's impossible to know whether or to what degree wearing a mask in public will reduce the odds of you becoming infected with the coronavirus, but on the whole it appears they provide at least *some* protection.

There's also the purely mechanical aspect: you're less likely to transfer the virus from your hands to your mouth or nose if there's something covering your mouth and nose.
