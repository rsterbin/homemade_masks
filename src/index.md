# Mask Wearing Guidelines

The CDC has recommended that everyone wear masks in public. What does that mean, and what do you need to know?

## Why you should wear a mask

COVID-19 is spread primarily through droplets of moisture from the mouth and nose.  Sneezing or coughing sprays them into the air around you, and there's some evidence that just breathing can spread smaller amounts of the virus shorter distances.  If you're carrying the virus, any mask you wear will keep most of those droplets from coming in contact with the people around you.

This is especially important now that we know nearly half of all people infected with the coronavirus don't have any symptoms.  Some of them will go on to develop symptoms in a few days, while others never will, but all of them can still infect other people.  Even if you're feeling perfectly healthy, it's important to wear a mask to reduce the risk that you'll pass it on to someone more vulnerable.

## Kinds of masks

There are three main kinds of masks.  They provide different levels of protection and are recommended for use in different contexts.

### Respirator mask (N95)

![n95 mask](./images/n95.jpg)

The gold standard for masks is the respirator mask (N95).  This mask is capable of filtering out 95% of particles as small as 0.007 microns. (The novel coronavirus is 0.1 microns, which is why medical professionals use N95s to treat COVID-19 patients safely.) It fits tightly around the nose and mouth, creating a seal to prevent any unfiltered air from getting in.  N95 masks must be fit-tested to ensure that they're airtight.  Traditionally, they're considered disposable: under normal conditions, a new mask would be required for each patient encounter.

However, there is currently a national shortage of N95 masks.  In order to ensure that medical care is available for as many people as possible, they **must** be reserved for health care workers.  Health care workers are already re-using masks: in the hardest-hit places, a single mask may be used for an entire shift, or even multiple shifts.

If you happen to have N95 masks at home, it's a good idea to contact your local hospital to see if they need donations.  Every respirator in the hands of a health care worker helps save lives.

**TODO: N95s used in construction have a filter that makes them useless for protecting others**

### Surgical masks

![surgical mask](./images/surgical.png)

The other kind of mask used in a medical setting is the basic surgical mask.  These masks vary in their filtering, typically block 1-micron particles, and are not tightly fitted.  They are also disposable, and should never be reused.

Surgical masks are more widely available than N95s, but there are still some shortages, especially in places where N95s are not available.  As much as possible, they should be reserved for health care and other essential workers.

### Cloth Masks

![cloth masks](https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/clothfacemasks-lowres-2x1-1-1024x512.jpg)

Cloth masks are not as effective at filtering small particles as either N95 or surgical masks, but they do still provide some protection.  Used properly, they can filter out 20-60% of 0.02 micron particles (less than half the size of the coronavirus).

How effective a cloth mask is, though, depends on what materials it's made of, and whether it's worn *correctly* and *safely*.

## How to wear a cloth mask

The most important thing to remember while wearing a mask is that it's an extra layer of protection, not a replacement for any precautions you were already taking!  You should still wash your hands frequently, keep at least six feet apart from anyone who isn't a member of your household, and avoid touching your face as much as possible.

### How to put on a mask

Start by washing your hands!  You're about to touch your face, and you don't want to transfer any particles that might be on the outside of the mask onto your face.  A freshly-washed mask is, of course, safe to touch, but training yourself to always put on your mask without touching the main body will make it less likely that you'll accidentally touch it if you need to put it back on after it's been used.

When you pick up your mask, the inside should be facing you, and the top of the mask should be up.  Carefully pick up the mask by the ear loops or ties, not the part that will touch your mouth and nose.

If your mask has elastic ear loops, use your fingers to spread them open, and put them around both ears at the same time, with the mask across your mouth and nose.

If your mask has ties, pick it up by the top ones.  Tie them securely high on the back of your head, with the mask across the bridge of your nose.  Then tie the bottom ones at the back of your neck.

Once it's on, carefully adjust the top band over the bridge of your nose, touching it as little as possible.  If your mask has a metallic strip, bend it into place.  Finally, pull the bottom edge under your chin.

Masks are only effective if they securely cover your nose and mouth.  The top of your mask should sit across the bridge of your nose, and the bottom should be under your chin.  The sides should fit closely.

Finally, wash your hands again, or use hand sanitizer, because you definitely touched your face.

### Removing your mask

Once again, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before you touch your face!

If your mask has ear loops, carefully put a finger through one loop and slip it off your ear, holding the mask away from your face while you unhook the other side.

If your mask has ties, untie the bottom ties first and let them dangle while you untie the top ties, then lift the mask away from your face.

If you don't need to wear your mask again for a while, you can wash it right away or place it with other possibly-contaminated laundry.

If you're going to need to put it back on again soon, lay it carefully inside-up on a paper towel (or other clean surface) with the loops or ties away from the body of the mask, so that you can easily pick it up again.

### Wearing your mask

Getting used to wearing a mask isn't easy.  If your mask is secured correctly, you'll probably feel a little stuffy and uncomfortable.  You should be able to breathe, but it won't feel normal.

Remember that you still shouldn't touch your face!  It may be tempting to adjust your mask, especially if it's slipped into an uncomfortable position, but you absolutely need to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after you touch it.  If your mask is doing its job, the outside surface could easily be contaminated, and if you're in public, your hands could be, too.

### Fit

Your mask does not need to create a perfect seal around your face, but it will be more comfortable to wear, and less likely to need a risky adjustment while you're wearing it, if it's snug, especially around the top edge. If you find yourself touching your mask while you're wearing it, you might need to change the shape to fit better.

If you find that the fit around your nose is awkward, you can more closely fit it to your face by including a bit of flexible metal or plastic.  You can use anything that can be easily pressed into shape, and keep its shape as long as you're wearing your mask -- easy to find options include floral or gardening wire, pipe cleaners, paper clips, or twist ties from your groceries. If you're sewing your mask, you can insert the wire into the seam. (Be sure to leave an opening so that you can take it out before washing, or replace it if necessary!) If you're using a no-sew mask, it will depend on what sort of fabric and design you've picked, but often you can fold or roll the top edge tightly around the wire to keep it in place for a short period.

If the sides are gaping too much, you can fold it the edge into a comfortable position and tack it down (sewing will be most secure, but you can also use glue, tape, or safety pins).

### Wearing glasses with a mask

Many people find that when they're wearing a mask, their glasses fog up, making it hard to see and forcing them to touch their faces to adjust or remove the glasses. This happens because warm air from your breath is escaping around the top of the mask, exactly where your glasses are sitting. There are three common ways to prevent your glasses from fogging up: improving the top seal, changing the position of your glasses, and using a surface treatment.

To improve the top seal, you can take a little extra time when putting the mask on to make sure the top edge fits closely around your nose. If it's not staying put, you may need a stiffer wire in the edge, or a tighter seam to hold it in place. You can also use any skin-safe adhesive (like a band-aid) to tape it down. If you slighly loosen the botton seam, more of the warm air can escapethat way. Just be careful not to loosen it too much -- a snug fit is still important for safety!

You can change the position of your glasses by wearing them a bit further away from your face than you normally would. Wrapping a rubber band around the nose pieces can help them cling to the mask rather than your nose. This change will definitely feel uncomfortable at first, but it can eliminate fog.

**Video demonstration of securely repositioning your glasses**

The simplest surface treatment is washing your glasses in soapy water, then allowing them to air dry. This will vary in effectivness depending on your lenses and the temperature, and some people may find the soapy film distracting.  You can also buy a spray specifically for this purpose, like FogTech Dx.

Generally speaking, you should go with whatever solution to glasses fog keeps you from touching your face.

### Disposable filters

For some people, it may be useful to add an extra layer to your mask to improve its filtering ability. A non-woven material like a paper towel inserted between two layers of a cotton mask makes it somewhat harder to breathe through but much better at filtering small particles. This is very much dependent on individual needs. If there are situations where you would prefer to trade a stuffier feel for more protections, and others where it's more important to breathe easily, you should try a mask with a filter pocket.

To use a filter pocket, you'd insert your chosen filter into a clean mask just before putting it on. (Paper towels are probably the best choice, having both good filtering properties and decent breathability. Coffee filters are often recommended, but they're so hard to breathe through most people can't keep them on.) When you return home and take your mask off, remove the filter and throw it away before washing your mask.

### How many cloth masks do I need?

At the very least, you need two: one to wear, and one to wash. If your situation involves going out in public more than once a day, or if you don't want to have to wash your used mask every night, you might want to have a few more. If you're using a disposable mask, you need one for each outing. (If you're using a disposable filter in a cloth mask, the same applies.)

## Mask Materials

The right material for a mask needs to be dense enough to filter out small particles, but thin enough to breathe through. Fortunately, there have been a few studies and independent experiments testing various materials on both counts.

This chart is from a study in 2013 testing particles smaller than the novel coronavirus:

![Mask materials by filtration effectiveness](https://smartairfilters.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mask-Materials-Effectiveness-0.02-Microns-EN.jpg)

And here's a chart from the same study, testing breathability:

![Mask materials by breathability](https://smartairfilters.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DIY-Mask-Breathability-EN-1.jpg)

The study authors recommended using two layers of either a T-shirt or a pillowcase, given how easily available those materials are and how well they balance filtration and breathability.

However, [another experiment this year](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-diy-coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-covid/) using a broader set of materials showed much worse filtration numbers for both (15% and 24%). This could easily be because both T-shirts and pillowcases are available in a lot of different weights, which means that the fibers may be packed very close in one T-shirt (making it an excellent filter) but very loosely in another. It indicated that natural fibers tended to perform better than synthetic ones, which is consistent with the first study, but there simply isn't a standard weight for T-shirts and pillowcases.

To select a fabric, you'll have to guess at its density and breathability, but fortunately there's an easy way to compare any fabrics you have on hand. First, hold them up to a light and compare how bright the light appears through each of them (this is your best guess at filtration effectiveness). Next, hold each one up to your mouth and nose and see how hard it is to breathe through. Try 2-4 layers of each. How you feel breathing through each fabric is the best information you have about how comfortable it will be to wear your mask.

## How to make a mask

There are a lot of face mask patterns and tutorials around online. How do you know which one is best?

To pick a mask, you should consider:

* Will it be comfortable enough to wear for long periods? Some people find the elastic in ear loops abrasive when worn for long periods. Others struggle not to touch the nose guard when it's installed at the top edge.
* What materials do you have at home? If you don't have a sewing machine or the perfect fabric, now is not the time to make an unnecessary purchase. If you have a basic sewing kit and a cotton T-shirt or pillowcase, you can still make a sewn mask.
* Can you sew? If you can't, there's no need wait until you'ved developed a whole new skill to start wearing a mask. There are a number of no-sew masks to choose from, so if you really want to learn to sew, you'll have a mask to wear while you figure it out.
* Do the materials you have provide enough of a filter for your needs? If you want to add extra filtering capabilities, making a mask with a pocket will allow you to use a disposable filtering material as well.

### No-Sew patterns

The CDC provides two simple options: one made from an old T-Shirt, and one made from a bandana.  You can find the patterns at the [bottom of the page here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html).

Here's a video tutorial for the T-shirt option:

[![CDC T-Shirt mask](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CPA-NnyIreU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLC4IaE_qoAb1oY95zO5cJsUtrhJgQ)
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPA-NnyIreU)

And here's one of the bandana options:

[![CDC Bandana mask](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ibk6NsTPjfw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&amp;rs=AOn4CLCyIkH-xl_Up7xZmmFqxIZlK9HX_A)
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibk6NsTPjfw)

If you need a disposable mask, you can create one from paper towels and rubber bands using a stapler:

[![Two-minute paper towel mask](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NCF7lCHMnII/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&amp;rs=AOn4CLD6hvdj47rTAPOnQW0jZtqJS8oZrg)
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCF7lCHMnII&t=7s)

These options are very simple, which is great! But they do have a few downsides: they're squared off instead of curved to fit the face, the sides are left open, they don't have anything in the top edge to mold to your nose, and they need to be reassembled after each wash. If you want to try something a little more difficult that might fit you better, here are a few options:

* [comfy five-minute T-shirt mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r51YroAFPds)
* [bandana mask with nose wire and filter pocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIjNScCWNDI)
* [T-shirt mask with nose wire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AVd8FiAQfM)

### Sewn patterns

The best sewn pattern is the one that you find comfortable and well-fitting. There are a lot of variations, but they tend to fall into one of three categories: cloth versions of surgical masks, shaped masks, and masks that combine the other two styles.

#### Cloth versions of surgical masks

The basic surgical mask is a rectangle folded into three horizontal pleats, secured with either elastic ear loops or long ties. This is a simple and effective pattern, and the pattern can easily be adjusted to fit people of all sizes.

Here's a video tutorial for a cloth surgical mask:

[![Surgical style mask](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AhGUBjK10DI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&amp;rs=AOn4CLAiUjzVluSqW99WEyDp1w1TZ6I4JQ)

Variations (video demonstrations):

* [Four-layer mask with ties and side binding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd4D5Ogepk)
* [Mask with ties, nose guard, and filter pocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3lcPRHo_nY)

#### Shaped masks

These masks are cut in a curved pattern that creates a close-fitting cup around the face. They're usually seamed at the center and don't have any pleating or gathers. Many people find them much more comfortable than the surgical style, but adjusting or scaling the pattern to fit different sizes and face shapes can be difficult.

Here's a video tutorial for a shaped mask using the [Fu mask pattern](https://freesewing.org/docs/patterns/fu/):

#### Combined style masks

These masks borrow from both styles, using a curved pattern but including pleats or gathers at the side to fit more people.

Here's a video tutorial for a combined style mask using the [AB mask pattern](https://www.instructables.com/id/AB-Mask-for-a-Nurse-by-a-Nurse/):

#### Tips

When sewing your mask, keep a few things in mind:

1. Knowing which side has been against your face is really important, so make sure your inner and outer sides are either made of different fabrics, or have an obvious front and back.

2. Sewing elastic is very difficult to find these days. If you want to make an ear-loops style mask, and you don't already have elastic already on hand, you can use elastic hair ties or rubber bands. Because these options can irritate the skin over time, you might want add a fabric cover for them.

3. Backstitch over the parts of your mask that will take the most strain -- strap attachment points, pleats, and darts can all use a little extra reinforcement.

4. Prewash your fabric. Your masks will need to be washed in hot water to be sterilized, and you don't want to waste time making a mask that will go out of shape after the first wash.

5. When making pleats, make sure they point down, with the pocket created by the pleat opening downward. This helps reduce the amount of dirt and other particulates getting caught within the pleats.

## Convince others!

Hopefully you're convinced that you should wear a mask, and you know how best to wear one. Please also pass what you've learned on to others. The more of us are wearing masks, the safer we all are!
