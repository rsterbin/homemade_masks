title: How to Wear a Mask
---

The most important thing to remember while wearing a mask is that it's an extra layer of protection, not a replacement for any precautions you were already taking!  You should still wash your hands frequently, keep at least six feet apart from anyone who isn't a member of your household, and avoid touching your face as much as possible.

### How to put on a mask

Start by washing your hands!  You're about to touch your face, and you don't want to transfer any particles that might be on the outside of the mask onto your face.  A freshly-washed mask is, of course, safe to touch, but training yourself to always put on your mask without touching the main body will make it less likely that you'll accidentally touch it if you need to put it back on after it's been used.

When you pick up your mask, the inside should be facing you, and the top of the mask should be up.  Carefully pick up the mask by the ear loops or ties, not the part that will touch your mouth and nose.

If your mask has elastic ear loops, use your fingers to spread them open, and put them around both ears at the same time, with the mask across your mouth and nose.

If your mask has ties, pick it up by the top ones.  Tie them securely high on the back of your head, with the mask across the bridge of your nose.  Then tie the bottom ones at the back of your neck.

Once it's on, carefully adjust the top band over the bridge of your nose, touching it as little as possible.  If your mask has a metallic strip, bend it into place.  Finally, pull the bottom edge under your chin.

Masks are only effective if they securely cover your nose and mouth.  The top of your mask should sit across the bridge of your nose, and the bottom should be under your chin.  The sides should fit closely.

Finally, wash your hands again, or use hand sanitizer, because you definitely touched your face.

### Removing your mask

Once again, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before you touch your face!

If your mask has ear loops, carefully put a finger through one loop and slip it off your ear, holding the mask away from your face while you unhook the other side.

If your mask has ties, untie the bottom ties first and let them dangle while you untie the top ties, then lift the mask away from your face.

If you don't need to wear your mask again for a while, you can wash it right away or place it with other possibly-contaminated laundry.

If you're going to need to put it back on again soon, lay it carefully inside-up on a paper towel (or other clean surface) with the loops or ties away from the body of the mask, so that you can easily pick it up again.

### Wearing your mask

Getting used to wearing a mask isn't easy.  If your mask is secured correctly, you'll probably feel a little stuffy and uncomfortable.  You should be able to breathe, but it won't feel normal.

Remember that you still shouldn't touch your face!  It may be tempting to adjust your mask, especially if it's slipped into an uncomfortable position, but you absolutely need to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after you touch it.  If your mask is doing its job, the outside surface could easily be contaminated, and if you're in public, your hands could be, too.

### Fit

Your mask does not need to create a perfect seal around your face, but it will be more comfortable to wear, and less likely to need a risky adjustment while you're wearing it, if it's snug, especially around the top edge. If you find yourself touching your mask while you're wearing it, you might need to change the shape to fit better.

If you find that the fit around your nose is awkward, you can more closely fit it to your face by including a bit of flexible metal or plastic.  You can use anything that can be easily pressed into shape, and keep its shape as long as you're wearing your mask -- easy to find options include floral or gardening wire, pipe cleaners, paper clips, or twist ties from your groceries. If you're sewing your mask, you can insert the wire into the seam. (Be sure to leave an opening so that you can take it out before washing, or replace it if necessary!) If you're using a no-sew mask, it will depend on what sort of fabric and design you've picked, but often you can fold or roll the top edge tightly around the wire to keep it in place for a short period.

If the sides are gaping too much, you can fold it the edge into a comfortable position and tack it down (sewing will be most secure, but you can also use glue, tape, or safety pins).

### Wearing glasses with a mask

Many people find that when they're wearing a mask, their glasses fog up, making it hard to see and forcing them to touch their faces to adjust or remove the glasses. This happens because warm air from your breath is escaping around the top of the mask, exactly where your glasses are sitting. There are three common ways to prevent your glasses from fogging up: improving the top seal, changing the position of your glasses, and using a surface treatment.

To improve the top seal, you can take a little extra time when putting the mask on to make sure the top edge fits closely around your nose. If it's not staying put, you may need a stiffer wire in the edge, or a tighter seam to hold it in place. You can also use any skin-safe adhesive (like a band-aid) to tape it down. If you slighly loosen the botton seam, more of the warm air can escapethat way. Just be careful not to loosen it too much -- a snug fit is still important for safety!

You can change the position of your glasses by wearing them a bit further away from your face than you normally would. Wrapping a rubber band around the nose pieces can help them cling to the mask rather than your nose. This change will definitely feel uncomfortable at first, but it can eliminate fog.

The simplest surface treatment is washing your glasses in soapy water, then allowing them to air dry. This will vary in effectivness depending on your lenses and the temperature, and some people may find the soapy film distracting.  You can also buy a spray specifically for this purpose, like FogTech Dx.

Generally speaking, you should go with whatever solution to glasses fog keeps you from touching your face.

### Disposable filters

For some people, it may be useful to add an extra layer to your mask to improve its filtering ability. A non-woven material like a paper towel inserted between two layers of a cotton mask makes it somewhat harder to breathe through but much better at filtering small particles. This is very much dependent on individual needs. If there are situations where you would prefer to trade a stuffier feel for more protections, and others where it's more important to breathe easily, you should try a mask with a filter pocket.

To use a filter pocket, you'd insert your chosen filter into a clean mask just before putting it on. (Paper towels are probably the best choice, having both good filtering properties and decent breathability. Coffee filters are often recommended, but they're so hard to breathe through most people can't keep them on.) When you return home and take your mask off, remove the filter and throw it away before washing your mask.
